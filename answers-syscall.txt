b syscall
bt

Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall?

#0  syscall () at kernel/syscall.c:133
#1  0x0000000080001d70 in usertrap () at kernel/trap.c:67
#2  0x0505050505050505 in ?? ()


What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent? (Hint: look user/initcode.S, the first user program xv6 starts.)
7, sys_exec


What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?
b *0x0000000080002050
p /x $sstatus
p /x $mstatus
0xa2


Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at. Which register corresponds to the variable num?
0x0000000080002050
a3


Why does the kernel crash? Hint: look at figure 3-3 in the text; is address 0 mapped in the kernel address space? Is that confirmed by the value in scause above? (See description of scause in RISC-V privileged instructions)
0xd
13 Load page fault


What is the name of the binary that was running when the kernel paniced? What is its process id (pid)?
(gdb) p p->name
$2 = "initcode\000\000\000\000\000\000\000"
(gdb) p p->pid
$3 = 1
